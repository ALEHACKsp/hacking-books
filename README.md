# hacking-books
wanna learn hacking as a pro?
1st thing you wanna know is operating systems
assuming you know that, you must learn then c/c++ programming languages and assembly IA32 / IA64 
and then RE aka reverse engineering and thats to know what are you dealing with on an operating system 
for example an service that work on an windows , you must 1st analys it, study it, and fuzz it looking for vulns, 
you will then think, ill get an known cve and try to build an exploit for it ... 
it doesnt work like this, you have to fuzz it , for example building an bufferoverflow exploit, you gotta know when the overflow will happen 
by continous fuzzing and debugging (i recomend immunity debugger)
ill later make a list for hacking tools i use with links to download it 
hacking is very complicated thing , its not easy , but its not impossible, nothing is..
with the right mindset and well ,you can do anything... 
download and read these books to know everything about hacking
